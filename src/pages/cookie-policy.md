This Cookie Policy explains how WattMaven ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our [website](https://www.wattmaven.com) and related services.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit websites. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.

## How We Use Cookies

We use cookies sparingly, with a focus on respecting your privacy. Here's how we use cookies on our website:

### Essential Cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and account authentication. You cannot opt out of these cookies.

- **Authentication cookies**: To remember your login status and maintain your session
- **Security cookies**: To support security features and detect suspicious activities
- **Load balancing cookies**: To distribute traffic to the website on several servers to optimize response times

### Analytics Cookies

We prioritize privacy in our analytics approach:

- **Fathom Analytics**: Our primary analytics provider does not use cookies and complies with GDPR, ePrivacy, COPPA, and CCPA. Your IP address is only briefly processed, and we have no way of identifying you through this service.
